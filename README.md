# MSFS Layout Generator

A drag-and-drop application for updating layout.json files in Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) packages.

## Q&A
### Q. What is a layout.json?
A. The Virtual File System (VFS) in Microsoft Flight Simulator relies on a layout.json file in the root of each package to determine which files it is allowed to load, and to perform a basic file integrity check.

### Q. What does this application do?
A. The application will create/update a layout.json with all current files in the layout.json file's folder and subfolders. The following information is included with each file entry:
* File name (including extension)
* Size (in bytes)
* Last modified time (represented as a [File Time](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/file-times))

The layout.json files generated by this tool should be identical to those generated by Microsoft Flight Simulator. (Note: File order may vary, but shouldn't impact functionality of packages)

### Q. Who is this application for?
A. This tool will benefit anyone who creates packages by hand rather than using the Project Editor in Developer Mode. Livery artists in particular may find this useful, as adding each texture to layout.json manually can be tedious.

## Usage
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/HughesMDflyer4/MSFSLayoutGenerator/releases/latest) from this repository and place the executable in a convenient location on your PC.
2. Drag any file named "layout.json" onto the exe.
3. Launch Microsoft Flight Simulator and check out your changes.

#### Notes
* The existing data in a layout.json will be overwritten/replaced when running the file through this tool.
* The application will only write to files named "layout.json" to avoid accidentally modifying unrelated files.
* Relative paths for layout.json files are suppported. Example:
```
C:\Users\Example\Desktop\MSFSLayoutGenerator.exe ExampleFolder\layout.json
```
* The application will update a variable number of layout.json files when providing the full path of each file. This can be useful when updating content across multiple packages. Example:
```
MSFSLayoutGenerator.exe "G:\MSFS\Community\example-package-1\layout.json" "G:\MSFS\Community\example-package-2\layout.json"
```

## Requirements
* Windows 10 (x64)
* .NET Framework 4.7.2
